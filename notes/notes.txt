notes

This first cartpole implementation uses a q table which discretizes the states into buckets. It's committed.

Next I want to use a deep Q network to replace the q table with a NN that approximates the quality function 
	- PPO and soft actor critic outperofrm q-learning in high dimensional state spaces. 
		- look into LSTM or GRU networks
