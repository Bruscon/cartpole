GPU Setup for TensorFlow and Gymnasium on Ubuntu
To get TensorFlow working with your NVIDIA RTX 3090 GPU on Ubuntu for Gymnasium/CartPole:
The standard installation didn't properly link TensorFlow with your GPU, despite having drivers installed.
The solution was to use TensorFlow's bundled CUDA option:
bash# In virtual environment
pip uninstall tensorflow -y
pip install tensorflow[and-cuda]
No need to manually install CUDA toolkit or cuDNN libraries as the bundled version includes everything.
Verification of successful GPU setup:
GPU is detected by TensorFlow
CUDA operations work correctly
Matrix multiplication executes on GPU
The warnings about duplicate registrations of CUDA components are harmless and can be ignored.
